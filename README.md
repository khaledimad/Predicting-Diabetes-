# Predicting-Diabetes-
Using different forms of classifiers to predict diabetes (SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression)

# Context
Diabetes is one of the deadliest and chronic diseases. About one in seven U.S. adults has diabetes now. By 2050, as many as one in three may become diabetic.

Many complications occur if diabetes remains untreated and unidentified.
Identifying patients who are at high-risk of becoming diabetic allows early medical interventions.

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

# Project

1) Develop ML models By applying LogisticRegression, SVM, RandomForest classification algorithms. <br>
2) Apply GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters for your models<br>
3) Assess model performance (confusion matrix, precision, recall, ROC AUC) and interpret performance from business impact viewpoint (false negatives vs false positives).
